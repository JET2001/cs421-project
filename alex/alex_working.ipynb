Whenever a user \"interacts\" with an item, it watches the movie and gives a \"rating\". There are 4 possible ratings: \"dislike\", \"neutral\", \"like\", and \"watched\". The \"watched\" rating indicates that the user has rated the movie, but the specific rating is unknown (that means you know that the user has watched the movie, but you don't know whether they liked it)."
